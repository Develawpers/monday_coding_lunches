# ASSIGNMENTS

To practice what we've learned on our fourth lunch, try and write one or more Python scripts (a `*.py` file, using whatever editor of your choice) according to the following tracks:

## track 1

Ask a user to enter their date of birth in dd/mm/YYYY format, parse it into a datetime object, then print it again in the format equivalent to this: `Monday, 14 of February 2022`

## track 2

Ask a user to enter their date of birth in dd/mm/YYYY format, parse it into a datetime object, then tell them how old they are in days and what day of the week they were born

## track 3

Ask a user to enter their date of birth in a format of your choosing, different from dd/mm/YYYY, then tell them how many days are left until their next birthday
