# ASSIGNMENTS

To practice what we've learned on our third lunch, try and write one or more Python scripts (a `*.py` file, using whatever editor of your choice) according to the following tracks:

## track 1


Use a dictionary to store all the information provided by the user as per Track 1 of of [Lunch 1's assignments](../lunch_1/ASSIGNMENTS.md), then, print out the dictionary.


## track 2


Given the list `numbers = [21, 14, 7, 26, 3, 19, 12, 9, 3, 14]` use a `for loop` to print all the numbers that are `grater than 10`

## track 3

Given the list of tuples `data = [("name", "Max"), ("role", "prosecutor"), ("trial", "5/2022")]`
create a `dict` out of it using a for loop and unpacking.
