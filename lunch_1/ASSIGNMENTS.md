# ASSIGNMENTS

To practice what we've learned on our second lunch, try and write one or more Python scripts (a `*.py` file, using whatever editor of your choice) according to the following tracks:

## track 1

```
Ask the user for their name, making sure that the value is assigned in Title Case
Ask the user for their age, and if they don't enter a valid digit, tell them so and that they have to start over
Ask the user for their location, and make it in upper case. 

Print out their info using an f-string, so that the output looks like this:
"
Here's your info:
name: Max
age: 28
location: VIENNA
"
```

## track 2

```
Ask a user to write a short bio of themselves.
Sanitize the bio so that there are no spaces or special characters at the beginning or at the end.
Print out the length of the bio in number of characters and the number of times that each punctuation character `.,;` appears using `.format()` with keyword arguments, so that the output looks like this:

"
total length: 26
fullstop: 3
comma: 2
semicolon: 0
"
```

## track 3

```
Ask a user to write a short bio about themselves.
Sanitize the input making sure that there are no extra spaces at the beginning and at the end of the string.
Sanitize further the string, making sure that all the words are single spaced from one another using `.split()` and `.join()`.
Use `.count()` to determine the number of *words* and print it out.
```
