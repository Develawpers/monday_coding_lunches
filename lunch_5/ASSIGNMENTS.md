# ASSIGNMENTS

To practice what we've learned on our fourth lunch, try and write one or more Python scripts (a `*.py` file, using whatever editor of your choice) according to the following tracks:

## track 1

Write a python script that uses three different functions to:
- ask a user their name
- ask a user their date of birth
- calculate their age in days

Finally, check if they're lying (age declared does not match with date of birth provided)

## track 2

Extend track 1's python script with a fuction that takes as positional arguments name and DoB, and a keyword argument for location with a default value set as "EU".
Return True if the user is over 18 and in EU; False if under 18 and in the EU.
Same with the US and 21.

## track 3

Extend track 2's python script with a function that takes as positional arguments age, DoB, can_drink, and an arbitrary number of keyword arguments.

Return a dictionary with all the arguments and keyword arguments as strings.
