Every one of the `seven lessons` will have its folder containing the
source code explained step-by-step.

We will use `git` so you get a glimpse of how software is actually
developed, versioned and maintained in the industry.

We will cover the basics of Python programming, starting from
what Python is, to writing a piece of software for a simple
real-world use case.

contribute to the discussion, ask questions, give feedback and what not.
