# ASSIGNMENTS

To practice what we've learned on our first lunch, try and write one or more Python scripts (a `*.py` file, using whatever editor of your choice) according to the following tracks:

## track 1

```
Ask a user for their name
Ask a user where they live
If the answer is "USA", tell them that the drinking age is 21
Else, tell them that the drinking age is 18
```

## track 2

```
Assume that the legal age for driving is 18
Ask a user for their name
Ask a user for their age
If their age is below the driving age, tell them how many years they have to wait to drive
Else if their age is equal to or greater than the driving age plus 10, tell them they have to renew their driver's license
Else tell them that they can enjoy driving
```

## track 3

```
Ask a user for their name
Ask a user where they live
Ask a user for their age
If they live in "USA" *and* they are below 21, tell them that they cannot drink, but they can have a gun instead
Else, if they live in "USA" *and* their age is greater than or equal to 21, telle them that they can have both a gun and a beer
Else, if they do not live in "USA" *and* their age is greater than or equal to 18, tell them that they can have a beer, but not a gun
Else, tell them that they can have neither
```

**PRO TIP**: you can combine `if` statements using the `and` clause, like so: `if a == 10 and b > 5:`
